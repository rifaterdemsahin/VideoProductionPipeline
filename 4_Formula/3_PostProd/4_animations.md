# 🎨 Post-Production Animation Guide

## 🧠 Overview & Strategy
- ⚡ Optimize animation timing and placement using canva.com with is a platform as a service for creating designs
- 🎯 Maintain consistent visual style with brand colors and fonts
- 📐 Follow golden ratio principles in the animation and placement of elements
- 🔄 Implement standardized workflows using this markdown file as a guide

## 📊 Previous Sprint Retrospective
- 🔍 Animation-footage integration needs refinement mention it in the prompter instance project
- 📝 Structured animation workflow required after the marker cuts using the template in the canva.com
- ⏱️ Timing consistency critical for quality by show timings feature and score with broll

## 🎬 Required Project Assets
- 🎥 Source Video Playground from copy process in canva.com
- 🔗 Sample Repository of the outputs: https://www.loom.com/looms/videos/video-playground-source-dc1c5b8136d74814907ce26bc6686e1b
- 📋 Animation Timing by watching the video and scoring it with broll

## ✨ Animation Production Workflow

### 1️⃣ Pre-Animation Setup
- 🎬 Footage Review & Marking
  - Identify key segments in the marker cuts with davinci resolve transcribe
  - Map transition points with the related animations and time them with the gpt
  - Document timing specs with prompter instance project

### 2️⃣ Design Environment
- 🎨 Canva Workspace Setup
  - Initialize project space from copy of the previous step footage sourced
  - Asset library import from the marker cuts as the main
  - Animation preset configuration use the source canva animations template to copy paste

### 3️⃣ Animation Standards & Guidelines
- 🔄 Motion Effects
  - Rise animation (3s duration)
  - Golden ratio positioning by having the lines ready in the master template 
  - 3 sec minimum/6 sec for a static shot /120 sec for a value list section for the timing framework
  - Typography  by using the brand fonts and colors

### 4️⃣ Quality Assurance
- 🔍 Technical Review
  - Subtitle positioning at the end with davinci resolve for all of the project
  - Marker cleanup for not used elements in the project
  - Element placement by using the canva guidelines
  - Transition smoothness by bulk implementation
  - Delete the golden ratio of timelines 

### 5️⃣ Final Validation
- ✅ Comprehensive Check
  - Timeline review
  - Visual quality audit
  - Animation flow testing
  - Improvement logging

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications
- 🎯 Background preservation protocol
- 🔄 Element repositioning system
- ⚡ Batch animation processing
- 📝 Subtitle scaling guidelines
